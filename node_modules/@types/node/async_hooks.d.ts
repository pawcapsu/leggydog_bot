     * });

     * The ID returned from `executionAsyncId()` is related to execution timing, not
     * causality (which is covered by `triggerAsyncId()`):

     * ```js
     * const server = net.createServer((conn) => {
     *   // Returns the ID of the server, not of the new connection, because the
     *   // callback runs in the execution scope of the server's MakeCallback().
     *   async_hooks.executionAsyncId();
     *
     * }).listen(port, () => {
     *   // Returns the ID of a TickObject (process.nextTick()) because all
     *   // callbacks passed to .listen() are wrapped in a nextTick().
     *   async_hooks.executionAsyncId();
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Promise contexts may not get precise `executionAsyncIds` by default.
     * See the section on `promise execution tracking`.
     * @since v8.1.0
     * @return The `asyncId` of the current execution context. Useful to track when something calls.

     * Resource objects returned by `executionAsyncResource()` are most often internal
     * Node.js handle objects with undocumented APIs. Using any functions or properties
     * on the object is likely to crash your application and should be avoided.
     *
     * Using `executionAsyncResource()` in the top-level execution context will
     * return an empty object as there is no handle or request object to use,
     * but having an object representing the top-level can be helpful.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { open } from 'fs';
     * import { executionAsyncId, executionAsyncResource } from 'async_hooks';
     *
     * console.log(executionAsyncId(), executionAsyncResource());  // 1 {}
     * open(new URL(import.meta.url), 'r', (err, fd) => {
     *   console.log(executionAsyncId(), executionAsyncResource());  // 7 FSReqWrap
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * This can be used to implement continuation local storage without the
     * use of a tracking `Map` to store the metadat
