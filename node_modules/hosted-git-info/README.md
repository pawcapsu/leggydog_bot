# hosted-git-info

This will let you identify and transform various git hosts URLs between
protocols.  It also can tell you what the URL is for the raw path for
particular file for direct access without git.

## Example

```javascript
var hostedGitInfo = require("hosted-git-info")
var info = hostedGitInfo.fromUrl("git@github.com:npm/hosted-git-info.git", opts)
/* info looks like:
{
  type: "github",
  domain: "github.com",
  user: "npm",
  project: "hosted-git-info"
}
*/
```

If the URL can't be matched with a git host, `null` will be returned.  We
can match git, ssh and https urls.  Additionally, we can match ssh connect
strings (`git@github.com:npm/hosted-git-info`) and shortcuts (eg,
`github:npm/hosted-git-info`).  GitHub specifically, is detected in the case
of a third, unprefixed, form: `npm/hosted-git-info`.

If it does match, the returned object has properties of:

* info.type -- The short name of the service
* info.domain -- The domain for git protocol use
* info.user -- The name of the user/org on the git host
* info.project -- The name of the project on the git host

## Version Contract

The major version will be bumped any time…

* The constructor stops accepting URLs that it previously accepted.
* A method is removed.
* A method can no longer accept the number and type of arguments it previously accepted.
* A method can return a different type than it currently returns.

Implications:

* I do not consider the specific format of the urls returned from, say
  `.https()` to be a part of the contract.  The contract is that it will
  return a string that can be used to fetch the repo via HTTPS.  But what
  that string looks like, specifically, can change.
* Dropping support for a hosted git provider would constitute a breaking
  change.

## Usage

### var info = hostedGitInfo.fromUrl(gitSpecifier[, options])

* *gitSpecifer* is a URL of a git repository or a SCP-style specifier of one.
* *options* is an optional object. It can have the following properties:
  * *noCommittish* — If true then committishe
